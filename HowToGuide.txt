Introduction and context

During the second term of this MSc programme, I joined a Work Placement module run by the University in partnership with OSNI.
The project in which I was invited to participate involved identifying areas of mixed land cover on orthophotography 4-band raster data (RGB + near infrared).
A significant amount of work had been covered by the OSNI team. There was, however, an area which for different reasons had been left unexplored: using machine learning (and in particular deep learning)
to solve this problem.  In particular, I became interested in applying deep learning in sparse sampling scenarios, as some of the literarture has shown (). 

Deep learning is a type of machine learning with several layers of nonlinear processing which allow users to identify patterns, objects, and pixels through models. 
It is a significant improvement on previous Machine Learning systems since it does not require vast amounts of training samples produced by expert users.

The Work Placement and the project were completed very successfuly: I managed to carry out pixel classification of orthophotography data provided by OSNI to identify land cover
using sparse sampling (the time I took to collect training samples was never more than 30').  The outcome of the classification was assessed and found to outperform previous approaches.

Although the project was a success, I realised there was room for improvement.  I had carried out the analysis using ArcGis Pro user interface.  However, I believed using ArcGis Pro's python environment,
libraries and dependencies would allow me to deepen my analysis, customise it and provide additional features to my audience.  Summarising, this project is the result of applying what I have learned in
EGM722 (Programming for GIS and Remote Sensing) to a topic I was presented while doing EGM725, and consists of providing a tool to carry out image classification of land cover by
 preprocessing target data, exporting training samples, training and evaluating deep learning models, and displaying results.
