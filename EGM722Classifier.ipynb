    "Deep learning is a type of machine learning with several layers of nonlinear processing which allow users to identify patterns, objects, and pixels through models. It is a significant improvement on previous Machine Learning systems since it does not require vast amounts of training samples produced by expert users. Several ArcGis Pro Deep Learning models support sparse training data with remarkable success. In this project, training data for our models was gathered in intervals of less than 30.\n",
