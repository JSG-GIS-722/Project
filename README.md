The best way to use this tool is to open the notebook EGM722Classifier.ipynb from a new ArcGis Pro project.  Some of the deep learning dependencies used here require the ArcGIS Image Analyst extension, 
ArcGIS Spatial Analyst extension or the ArcGIS 3D Analyst extension, so a licensed copy of ArcGis Pro needs to be open while running the notebook.  This repository includes the required .yml file (created using
conda env export > environment.yml) to duplicate the python environment, but the before mentioned licensing constrains still apply, though.
